                    </cite> It is a global movement that encourages people to reduce meat in their diet for
                    not only their own health but the health of the planet. By eating less meat, and more plant based
                    products,
                    this helps conserve water, saves energy and combat climate change

                    <b><i>Climate Change</i></b> - Climate change looms as one of the biggest environmental
                    crises in human history and the lifecycle and supply chain of livestock products is the largest 
                    contributor of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions worldwide.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Currently, the livestock sector is one of the biggest contributors to the worsening climate. 
                    It emits an estimate amount go 7.1 gigatonnes of CO2 every year, which is 14.5% of human-induced emissions.
                     Cattles contribute to 65% of the 7.1 gigatonne of emission. An estimated 1.29 billion metric tonnes of 
                     waste is produced by the Chinese pork industry every year. And in North America, there exists a “dead zone”,
                    located in the Gulf of Mexico, is depleted of oxygen, due to the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution causes by
                    the hog industry
                    <hr>
                    A 2010 Canadian Study warns of a livestock greenhouse gas boom where soaring international
                    production
                    of livestock could, by 2050, release enough carbon into the atmosphere to single-handedly exceed
                    safe
                    levels of climate change: the livestock sector's emissions alone, if continuing on the current
                    demand,
                    supply trajectory, could send temperatures above the 2 degrees Celsius rise optimistically said to
                    be
                    the threshold above which climate change will be dangerously destabilising.

                                While beef and lamb generate comparable amounts of methane and require similar quantities of feed, 
                                lamb generates more emissions per kilo in part because it produces less edible meat relative to the 
                                sheep's live weight
                            </p>

                            The difference between the 3 figures is quite huge isn't it? That is because the amount of water used 
                            by the cows takes into account the water used to grow it's food. From its day to day life, a large amount 
                            of water is required to keep it healthy, and this large amount of water would only give you around 300 grams
                            of beef. Whereas, a smaller quanity of water is only required to give you 300 grams of wheat and vegetables.
                            </p>

                        </div>

                <p>
                    Thus, proving that for livestocks, especially cattle, contributes the most amount of damage to our environment. 
                    In order to reduce such effects, we should decrease our demand for meat.

                            Everyone knows vegetables are good for you, but do you know that eating lesser meat also has health benefits?
                            Most meat conists of high amount of saturated fat and is high cholesterol and most processed meat has too much
                            sodium. Eating lesser of these types of meat can help reduce risk of Heart Diseases, Hypertension, Type 2 diabetes
                            and many more.

                            As seen in the above sections, eating less meat will reduce the demand for meat. With lesser demand, there will be
                            lesser need for a large supply of animals. This will result in less greenhouse gas produced by the livestock. 
                            Lesser Livestock also means more space is being freed up and reforestion of that area can begin, which will further
                            reduce the greenhouse gas in our atmosphere.

                 And if you ever feel that you are alone in this journey or are looking for someone to join you, there are many 
                 Meatless Monday organisations that you can join and share your experience and get tips and tricks on how to make your
                 meal better!
                 Remember, though it is a small action, together with others that have taken on this challenge, these efforts
                 contribute to a better future.

                    In every meal, proteins and carbohydrates are what gives you energy and keeps you full. While
                    taking on the Meatless Monday challenge, your meals will consist of the same too! For first timers,
                
                    It is best to go with plant-based food such as the Impossible Burger. The Impossible burger is
                    mainlymade of soy proteins and contains yeast fermented heme, which is what gives the Impossible
                    burger its meaty taste despite containg no meat at all. When eating this, the difference is
                    practically "impossible" to tell.

                <h4>
                    Instead of meat, try soybean alternatives such as Tofu and Tempeh.

                            <p>
                                Let's crank up the flavors as we take on this receipe. This is a vegan spin of the popular asian food, Baos, 
                                and you wouldn't expect the ingredients to work so well together. If you are looking for the signature meatiness
                                of the Baos when you try this recipe, try using the impossible meat as a subsititue.
